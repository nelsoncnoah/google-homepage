This is an Odin Project challenge to recreate the Google Homepage from scratch using nothing but HTML and CSS.

This project involves making my first HTML+CSS website from scratch, featuring a waterfall of tears, research, self-repairing my laptop screen (don't ask), and loads of accomplishment when I can position some text where I want it.
